Concept: Check for collisions by indicating the required switches for collision checks.

(V) ----A------------- (I)
         \
          B----------- (II)
           \
  |--(VI)---C
             \
              D------- (III)
               \
  |--(VII)------E----- (IV)

Example requirement codes:

   I-V   > 00001
 III-V   > 01111
  IV-VII > 10000

There are at most 3 parallel sequences. Whenever a new sequence is to be added, all the existing ones must be checked for collisions.
This collision check can be performed by the folling indicator:

  C(x, y) = ((x * y) â‰  0)

Any existing sequence must be cleared if it would collide with the new one.
After removing all colliders, the new sequence can be stored into any unused slot.

Each sequence slot is also decorated with a proto-code slot. This slot holds a partial code encoding the actual sequence.




main 9
loc  5
rel  4

9 * 5 * 4 = 9 * 20 = 180  (theoretically OK)
